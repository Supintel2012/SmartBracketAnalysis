## The 30-Second Pitch

> "SmartBracket uses patented math to win March Madness pools — not by predicting winners better, but by finding the picks that beat the most people in your pool. It's built on the same optimization approach Wall Street uses for portfolio management, and it's been consistently in the 90th percentile for 10 years."

## The 3-Minute Version (Conversation Guide)

**Hook:** "Most people think winning a bracket pool means picking the most likely winners. That's actually the wrong problem."

**Problem:** In a pool, picking Duke when 80% of the field also picks Duke earns you *nothing* if Duke wins. The contrarian who picked the 20% team leaps over the whole field.

**Solution:** SmartBracket's algorithm simultaneously weighs (1) the statistical probability a team wins and (2) how popular that team is in the crowd — then solves all 63 picks as one interconnected optimization problem, not 63 separate guesses.

**Proof:** ~90th percentile average over 10 years of the ESPN bracket challenge. Our cohort outperformed all major AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) on a multi-year consistency basis in 2025.

**Protection:** 3 US patents + Japanese + Korean patents. No competitor can copy the core algorithm until 2033–2035 at the earliest.

**Bigger Story:** The same engine — called the Rapid Recursive® Toolbox — solves the same class of problem for fleet management, real estate pricing, workforce planning, and financial planning. Brackets are the proof of concept for a much larger enterprise platform.

## Common Objections & Responses

### "ChatGPT does this for free."
We actually tested ChatGPT head-to-head with SmartBracket in the ESPN Tournament Challenge. In 2024 — its first standalone test — ChatGPT finished at the **45.7th percentile**. SmartBracket's best bracket that year hit **97.4%**. That's a 51.7-point gap, and both results are publicly verifiable on ESPN. In 2025, ChatGPT 4.5 improved to 75.9% — but that's still below SmartBracket's cohort average. And OpenAI's O3 Mini finished at 41.2% that same year, showing the AI variance problem: you might get 98th percentile, or you might get 41st. SmartBracket is consistently in the 80s and 90s.

### "It's just $5 — can it really be that good?"
ROI framing: If you're in a 100-person $10 pool, the expected payout at the 90th percentile is roughly $10–20 in expected value on a $5 purchase. That's 200–400% ROI. The low price actually undersells it.

### "This only works for March Madness."
SmartBracket is just the most visible application. The Rapid Recursive® Toolbox has 16+ ready-to-run templates for enterprise problems — machine replacement decisions, property valuation, hiring optimization, retirement planning. The brackets demonstrate the tech; the enterprise licensing is the business model.

### "Machine learning is better than math formulas."
This isn't ML vs. math — it's about the *right* problem formulation. ML would need labeled data about "optimal pool-winning brackets." We don't have that. Operations research (Markov Decision Processes) is the correct tool because it's mathematically provable: Value Iteration finds the *optimal* policy for any MDP. The question is whether we've formulated the right MDP — and 10 years of results say yes.

### "Anyone could build this."
If they could, they would have. The algorithm's reward function — the specific way we balance contrarian value against statistical probability across sequential decisions — is protected by patent. Even if competitors understood the approach, they can't legally implement it until 2033–2035.

## Technology Vocabulary Cheat Sheet

| Term | Plain English |
|------|---------------|
| Sequential Decision Problem | A chain of decisions where each choice affects future options (like chess, not checkers) |
