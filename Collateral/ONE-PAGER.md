# SmartBracket — One-Pager
### Powered by the Rapid Recursive® Toolbox

---

**What is it?**
SmartBracket is the only patented NCAA bracket optimizer that treats tournament picks as what they really are: a sequential, interdependent optimization problem. Instead of picking the most likely winners, the algorithm finds the bracket that maximizes your expected *pool standing* — a fundamentally different (and harder) problem.

**How does it work?**
The Rapid Recursive® engine applies Value Iteration — the same technique used in financial portfolio optimization and robotics — to a 63-decision game tree. It simultaneously weighs statistical win probability *and* crowd pick distributions, so it knows when to zig while everyone else zags.

**Does it work?**
~90th percentile average across 10 years of the ESPN bracket challenge. Our cohort outperformed all major AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) on a multi-year average in 2025, 80.9% vs. 71.8%.

**Is it protected?**
Yes — 3 US patents, 1 Japanese patent, 1 Korean patent, valid through 2033–2035. No competitor can legally replicate the core algorithm.

**What else can it do?**
The underlying Rapid Recursive® Toolbox solves the same class of problem in fleet management, workforce planning, real estate pricing, retirement planning, and more. Brackets are the showcase. Enterprise licensing is the business.
