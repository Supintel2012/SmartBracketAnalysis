# SmartBracket vs. AI — The Competition Record
### Verified Results with Live ESPN Bracket Links (2023–2025)

All results benchmarked against the ESPN Tournament Challenge — the world's largest bracket pool with 20+ million entries. Percentile scores are final, post-tournament standings.

## The Three-Act Story

**2023 — ChatGPT as a Tool, Not a Competitor**
ChatGPT had just launched (November 2022). Rather than treating it as a competitor, we tested it as a *prompt input* to SmartBracket — using ChatGPT's natural-language tournament analysis to inform our team weighting questions. The ChatGPT+SmartBracket hybrid tied with pure SmartBracket at 83.2%, confirming the algorithm was robust even when human-style AI input was layered on top.

**2024 — First Standalone AI Test. ChatGPT Loses Badly.**
In 2024 we ran ChatGPT as an independent bracket for the first time. The results were stark: ChatGPT finished at the **45.7th percentile** — below the average ESPN entrant. SmartBracket's best bracket hit the **97.4th percentile**. That's a 51.7-point gap. The hype didn't match the performance.

**2025 — Full AI Competition. 10 Models. One Winner.**
In 2025 we ran a structured competition: 6 SmartBracket brackets + 12 AI model brackets + 7 benchmarks = 25 total entries. Every entry was submitted to the ESPN Tournament Challenge with public, verifiable links. Claude Sonnet 3.7 won at 98.4% — a truly exceptional result. But the AI field ranged from 41% to 98%, and the *average* AI bracket finished at 71.8th percentile — 9 points below the SmartBracket cohort average of 80.9%.

**Key takeaway (2023):** ChatGPT was so new it was used as a *research input*, not a standalone predictor. The hybrid tied the pure algorithm — suggesting LLMs can inform but not replace the optimization engine.

**Gap: SmartBracket beat ChatGPT by 51.7 percentile points.**

**Key takeaway (2024):** ChatGPT underperformed the average ESPN entrant (who would sit at roughly the 50th percentile by definition). SmartBracket's worst-performing bracket (89.6%) was still 44 points above ChatGPT. The AI hype hadn't yet translated into bracket performance.

### 2025 Cohort Averages

| Group | Average Percentile | Range | Consistency |
|-------|--------------------|-------|-------------|
| **SmartBracket (all entries)** | **~80.9%** | 68.8%–92.4% | Lower variance |
| AI models (all 12) | 71.8% | 41.2%–98.4% | High variance |
| Benchmarks (pick-the-favorites methods) | 40.4% | 9.2%–71.1% | — |

**Key takeaway (2025):** AI improved dramatically from 2024. One model (Claude Sonnet 3.7) hit 98.4% — an extraordinary outlier. But the average AI model finished at 71.8th percentile — 9 points below the SmartBracket cohort average. The variance is the story: AI is a lottery ticket. SmartBracket is a calculated edge.

## The AI Reliability Problem

In 2025, we documented the following issues with AI-generated brackets:

| AI Model | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Grok 3 | Missing predictions for 3 first-round games; required follow-up prompts |
| Perplexity DeepResearch | Missing team data for 14 matchups despite using 92 sources |
| ChatGPT 4.5 | Did not complete Final Four; contained self-contradicting picks |
| Gemini DeepResearch | Predicted eliminated teams advancing; Final Four errors |
| Copilot | Two-conference confusion; incomplete regions |
| Qwen 2.5 Max | Hallucinated Virginia advancing — a team not in the 2025 tournament |
| O3 Mini | Incomplete analysis across all four regions |
| Most models | Non-deterministic: same prompt yields different brackets on repeat runs |

**SmartBracket is fully deterministic.** The same inputs always produce the same output. No hallucinations. No missing games. This is the difference between operations research and generative AI.

## The Three-Year Summary

| Year | Best SmartBracket | AI Competitor(s) | Outcome |
|------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| 2023 | 83.2% (1-click) | ChatGPT used as input, not standalone — matched SB at 83.2% | AI useful as a tool, not a replacement |
| 2024 | **97.4%** | ChatGPT standalone: 45.7% | **SB won by 51.7 percentile points** |
| 2025 | ~92.4% (full cohort top) | Claude Sonnet: 98.4% (winner); AI avg: 71.8% | AI's best beat SB's best; AI's average lost to SB's average |

## What This Means for the Future

**Short term:** AI will continue improving. Claude Sonnet's 98.4% in 2025 is genuinely impressive. In any given year, a top AI model might match or beat SmartBracket.

**Long term:** The Rapid Recursive® Toolbox's value isn't in any one year's performance — it's in:
1. **Consistency** — no 41st-percentile disasters like O3 Mini
2. **Reliability** — no hallucinated teams, no incomplete brackets
3. **Explainability** — every pick traces to a mathematical reason, not a black-box prediction
4. **Patent protection** — the approach is legally protected through 2033–2035

The AI competition results strengthen, not weaken, the enterprise pitch: we now have a live, multi-year, multi-model benchmark proving that our algorithm is consistently competitive with the best AI tools — while being reliable in ways that generative AI is fundamentally not.
