# The SmartBracket Story

## The One-Sentence Version

SmartBracket uses a **patented mathematical engine** to solve March Madness brackets the way Wall Street solves portfolio risk — turning 63 gut-feel decisions into one optimal strategy backed by 10+ years of real-world results.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Every March, 70 million Americans fill out NCAA tournament brackets. Almost everyone uses the same strategy: pick the favorites. The problem? So does everyone else. Picking the same teams as the crowd might make you accurate, but it won't make you *win your pool*.

Winning a pool requires a different question: **not "who is most likely to win?" but "who gives me the best chance of finishing above everyone else?"**

Those are fundamentally different optimization problems — and we built the only patented tool that solves the second one.

## Our Technology: The Rapid Recursive® Toolbox

At the heart of SmartBracket is the **Rapid Recursive® (RR) Toolbox** — a Sequential Decision Problem engine developed and patented by Supported Intelligence LLC.

### What Makes It Different

Most bracket tools treat each game independently. Our engine recognizes that a tournament bracket is what mathematicians call a **Sequential Decision Problem** (also known as a Markov Decision Process, or MDP): 63 interdependent decisions where picking Team A in Round 1 changes the optimal pick in Round 3.

Think of it like chess vs. checkers: checkers players look one move ahead; chess grandmasters think 10 moves ahead. Most bracket tools play checkers. SmartBracket plays chess.

### The Algorithm in Plain English

1. **Build a game tree.** Map all 63 games as a connected decision network.
2. **Balance two forces.** For every pick, weigh (a) the statistical likelihood the team wins, and (b) how few people in your pool are picking them. The "contrarian premium" is real — if everyone picks Duke and Duke loses, you gain nothing. If *you* picked the upset, you leap over half the field.
3. **Optimize the whole bracket at once.** Using Value Iteration (the same math used in financial portfolio optimization and robotics path planning), find the single bracket that maximizes your **expected pool standing**.
4. **Personalize to your pool.** Answer 3 quick questions — which teams are popular in your pool, which are overrated, which are underrated — and the algorithm adjusts probability weights by up to ±20% to exploit your specific competition.

### The Patent Portfolio

The approach is protected by:
- **US Patents** 9,798,700 · 10,460,249 · 10,546,248
- **Japanese Patent** 6,284,472
- **Korean Patent** 10-2082522
- Multiple patents pending

Patent protection runs through **2033–2035**, giving competitors no legal path to copy our core formulation.

## 10 Years of Proof

SmartBracket launched in 2016. Our algorithm has been benchmarked against the broader ESPN bracket pool every year since.

| Year Range | SmartBracket Performance |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 9-year average | ~90th percentile |
| 2025 cohort average | 80.9th percentile |
| GenAI (ChatGPT, Claude) 2025 | 71.8th percentile |

**Key insight:** AI chatbots had one great year in 2025 (one model hit 98th percentile), but with extremely high variance. SmartBracket delivers **consistent, repeatable edge** — the kind that matters when you enter the same pool year after year.

For context: if you're in a 100-person $10 pool, getting to the 80th–90th percentile gives you a **10–20x return** on the $5 SmartBracket purchase. That's 200–400% ROI.

## The Bigger Picture: Beyond Brackets

SmartBracket is the most visible application of a general-purpose optimization engine. The same Rapid Recursive® math that picks brackets also powers solution templates for:

| Template | Real-World Application |
|----------|------------------------|
| AutoDriveOrSell | Fleet management & vehicle replacement |
| HiringWithPolicyRisk | Workforce planning under uncertainty |
| MachineReplacement | CapEx planning & equipment lifecycle |
| PropertyValuation | Real estate pricing optimization |
| HouseholdSaving | Retirement & financial planning |
| ForestManagement | Natural resource planning |
| AutoMarketShare | Competitive market dynamics |

The brackets are the proof of concept. The enterprise is the prize.

## Talking Points for Student Ambassadors

**"What makes it different from free AI bracket tools?"**
> "AI tools like ChatGPT are good at picking favorites — they had one great year in 2025. But their results are unpredictable. SmartBracket's algorithm has averaged ~90th percentile over 10 years by solving a fundamentally different problem: not 'who wins' but 'how do I beat my pool.' That consistency is the product."

**"Why does it cost money if AI is free?"**
> "A $5 investment that gives you a 20% shot at winning a $200 pool is a 400% expected return. Free AI is a lottery ticket. SmartBracket is a calculated edge."

**"Is this just statistics?"**
> "It's operations research — the same math used in airline revenue management, financial portfolio optimization, and autonomous vehicle routing. Most people have never seen it applied to sports. That's the innovation."

**"Has anyone tried to copy it?"**
> "They can't — it's patented in the US, Japan, and Korea until 2033–2035. The algorithm formula is the innovation, and it's protected."
