# SmartBracket 2026 Strategic Plan
## COO Recommendations: Showcase Strategy & Supported Intelligence Integration

**Prepared For:** COO, Supported Intelligence
**Date:** January 2026
**Document Type:** Strategic Planning & Execution Roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the SmartBracket codebase, financials, and market position, I recommend a fundamental repositioning for 2026:

**Stop treating SmartBracket as a revenue business. Start treating it as your most compelling sales asset.**

SmartBracket's 9-year track record of ~90th percentile performance is worth more as a **credibility engine** for Supported Intelligence's enterprise RRToolbox offerings than as a $2,107/5-year consumer product.

### 2026 Strategic Priorities

| Priority | Objective | Investment |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | MDP vs. LLM Bake-Off 2.0 (Credibility Campaign) | $2,000-5,000 |
| 2 | Supported Intelligence Integration | $0 (student labor) |
| 3 | Controlled Marketing Experiment | $1,000-2,000 |
| 4 | Enterprise Lead Generation | $0-1,000 |

**Total Recommended 2026 Budget:** $3,000-8,000 (vs. $9,461 spent on failed paid media 2022-2024)

---

## Part 1: Strategic Positioning

### The Problem with Current Approach

| Metric | Historical (2020-2024) | What It Means |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| Total Revenue | $2,107 | Product is not viable at scale |
| Total Marketing Spend | $16,897 | 8x revenue spent on acquisition |
| CAC | $37.98-$94.08 | Losing $33-89 per customer |
| Consumer Market Trend | Commoditizing (free AI) | Getting worse, not better |

**Continuing the current approach will lose more money.**

### The Repositioning

| Old Positioning | New Positioning |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| SmartBracket is a consumer product | SmartBracket is a demonstration |
| Goal: Acquire paying users | Goal: Generate enterprise leads |
| Success metric: Revenue | Success metric: Qualified leads for RRToolbox |
| Marketing: Paid acquisition | Marketing: Content + credibility |

### Why This Works

1. **The 9-year track record cannot be bought** - It's your most defensible asset
2. **Free AI makes consumer market unprofitable** - But increases interest in "beating AI"
3. **Enterprise customers want proof** - SmartBracket IS the proof
4. **March Madness gets attention** - Use that attention for Supported Intelligence

## Part 4: Marketing Strategy

### Recommendation: Minimal Paid, Maximum Organic

Based on historical data:
- Paid media CAC: $94-117 (unsustainable)
- Organic/email CAC: $2-10 (sustainable)

**2026 Approach:** Invest in content and credibility, not paid acquisition.

### Marketing Budget Allocation

| Channel | 2024 Spend | 2026 Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Rotowire Partnership | $2,500 | $0 | $117 CAC, negative ROI |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | $5,000+ | $0 | Commoditized market |
| LinkedIn Organic | $0 | $500 (promoted posts) | B2B audience for SI |
| Content Creation | $0 | $1,000-2,000 | Bake-off content, case studies |
| Student Labor | N/A | $1,500-3,000 | Execution capacity |
| Email/MailChimp | $53 | $100 | Maintain existing list |

**Total 2026 Marketing Budget:** $3,100-5,600

### Student Resource Plan

**Scope:** 1-2 students, 10-15 hours/week during Feb-April

| Task | Hours/Week | Duration | Skills Needed |

| Social media management | 3-5 | Feb-Apr | Social media, design |
| Website updates | 2-3 | Feb-Mar | Basic web/CMS |
| Content creation | 3-5 | Feb-Apr | Writing, graphics |

**Estimated Cost:** $15-20/hour × 10-15 hours × 12 weeks = $1,800-3,600

### Content Strategy

|--------------|----------|---------|-------|
| Bake-off blog posts | 6-8 | Credibility, SEO | Student |

## Part 5: Product Strategy (Minimal Investment)

### Recommended Changes (Low Effort)

| Change | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Fix MD5 password hashing | 1-2 days | Critical security | **P0** |
| Remove hardcoded FB secret | 1 hour | Security | **P0** |
| Add SI branding/links | 2-3 hours | Integration | P1 |
| Add "Powered by RRToolbox" | 1 hour | Branding | P1 |
| Update year data files | 1-2 days | Maintenance | P1 |

### NOT Recommended for 2026

| Change | Why Not |
|--------|---------|
| Freemium model | Requires significant dev work, uncertain ROI |
| Subscription pricing | Market is commoditizing, wrong direction |
| Mobile app updates | iOS/Android dev cost, minimal return |
| New features | Product is demonstration, not growth product |

### "Good Enough" Product State

SmartBracket should be:
- ✓ Functional and secure
- ✓ Branded as Supported Intelligence
- ✓ Positioned as demonstration, not product
- ✗ NOT optimized for consumer growth
- ✗ NOT investing in new features

### Sales Messaging

```
"You've seen how our optimization approach outperforms AI in bracket
prediction. The same technology can be applied to [your industry problem].

SmartBracket is our public demonstration—9 years of verifiable results.
Your business decisions don't need to be public, but they can benefit
from the same rigorous optimization.

---

## Part 9: Risk Assessment

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| SmartBracket underperforms in bake-off | 30% | High | Frame as "one year" vs. 9-year track record |
| No enterprise leads generated | 40% | Medium | Content still has SEO/credibility value |
| Student unavailability | 20% | Medium | Start early, have backup |
| Security breach (MD5) | 10% | Critical | **Fix before tournament** |
| LLMs significantly improve | 50% | Medium | Emphasize consistency, not single-year |

### Contingency Plans

**If SmartBracket underperforms:**
- Emphasize 9-year track record vs. single year
- Highlight variance in LLM performance
- Focus on "consistency" narrative

**If no enterprise leads:**
- Content still builds SEO and credibility
- Learnings inform 2027 approach
- Consider academic publication route
